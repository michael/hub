    h2 Download The Composer
    
    p.descr The Substance Composer is a desktop application (Mac OSX), where you create and manage digital documents. While traditional text editors usually deal with visual information (emulating its representations on paper), the Substance Composer is developed around the idea that content is data. Its structured document composition allows documents to be stored and represented in multiple arbitrary ways. On top of that, with its collaborative features you can annotate, comment and revise your content with anyone.

    p.descr 
      | After a two-year experimental phase, our next goal is putting Substance in production. We sat down, worked out a roadmap and launched a <a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/18902" target"_blank">campaign</a> to back development costs. With the help of your donation we could make it happen, which is exciting! If you like the idea of Substance and want to see it in action, please support us.
